Whenever I look around I see busy people, doing so many things but in the end doing nothing at all.

I'm a software engineer who loves elegant code and innovative approaches to find the best solutions.  
Code and design aren't completely separate concepts, the difficult part that requires creativity is using them together
in a way to develop amazing software that works well and is easy to use.

In a way writing code and designing an interactive user experience is art.
There are no boundaries on what can be expressed through code, which is the reason why my passion will last a lifetime.
