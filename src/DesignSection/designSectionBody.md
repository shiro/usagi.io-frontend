Something that is functional is good, however for it to become a true piece of art function alone is not sufficient.


I want all of my projects to look beautiful and deliver an experience that surpasses the users' expectations.

Whenever I design web or desktop applications, or just edit the pictures I took with my camera, I always want it to
look perfect.
In order to fulfill my own expectations, I enjoy prototyping, asking for feedback and making plans on how to further
improve my designs.

The task of designing user interfaces and experiences should not be taken lightly, it is art after all.
