There are many interesting art styles, that allow artists to produce interesting images,
however I've always enjoyed looking at **pixel art** the most.

It's a very **simple and minimalistic** way of presenting content, and I think that it being so
**abstract** is the reason many people enjoy it so much.
Even though it is so simple, it allows me to express myself well with just a small range of
colors and shapes.

Of course there is also something **nostalgic** about it, since like many other people,
it reminds me of all the fun I had when I was a kid, playing some amazing video games.
