Designing websites that look stunning and offer a good user experience is
a very **creative task** that I really enjoy doing.

For me, **expressing myself** though my **design** is important, and the web offers
a platform that everyone can use and imposes no limitations on the visual aspect,
allowing me to design **amazing looking websites** and **web-applications** and actually
implement them.
