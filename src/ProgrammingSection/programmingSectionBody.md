Expressing myself through code is very important to me.

I'm often asked what programming language I work in and what I do specifically,
however there is no single answer to this question.

Like there exist many beautiful languages in the world, there are various programming languages,
each with their good and bad parts.

There is no single best programming language, so why limit oneself to one in the first place?

I like web development and have worked with `react` since its inception. I also like working with
`rust`, `python`, `C/C++`, `C#` and so on, whatever tool is best suited for the task should be used.

I'm interested to work with many technologies and stumbling upon new ones as they emerge.
Constant learning is required to expand our horizon and keep track of the bigger picture.
