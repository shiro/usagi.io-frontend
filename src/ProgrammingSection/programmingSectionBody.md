Expressing myself through code is very important to me.

I'm often asked what programming language I work in and what I do specifically,
however there is no single answer to this question.
Like there exist many beautiful languages in the world, there are various programming languages,
each with their good and bad parts.

I'm interested to work with many technologies and stumbling upon new ones as they emerge.
Constant learning is required to expand our horizons and keep track of the bigger picture.
