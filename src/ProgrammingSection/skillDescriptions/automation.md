Tasks that are tedious and repetitive should be automated whenever possible.
Following this simple concept allows me to focus on essential parts of my
job rather than wasting time for running tests or deployment.

I love **writing scripts, managing CI pipelines** and **optimizing
my workflow** in order to make it as efficient as possible.
Developing software is my passion and automation helps me remove all unnecessary work.
