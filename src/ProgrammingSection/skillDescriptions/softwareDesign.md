Designing **complex systems** and thinking about how to **structure code** in a way
that supports future extensions is a fun challenge. Through my work I've built
several systems that provide **web services**, **handle email** and **load balance
traffic** between subsystems.

Getting it completely right is very difficult, however after working with such
systems for some time it has become easier to ask the right **questions** and find the
right **answers**.
