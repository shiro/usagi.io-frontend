Version control using is important for managing code changes in all projects, since
it allows to easily track code changes and enable big decentralized teams to work together seamlessly.

Through **many years** of using git when working on both **small and large codebases**
and learning about its inner workings I know exactly how to integrate
code and sometimes even help people recover their "lost" work.
