One of the areas where I have most experience in is **web development**.
The web has always fascinated me, and I've been working on various websites and
web applications since I was a kid.
In the Java Script world popular libraries change
a lot, therefore I've worked with many libraries such as **Redux, Mobx, Webapck,
GraphQL, JQuery** and many others.

I consider myself a **full stack web developer** and enjoy working on the UI/UX
and the server side. Having to deal with interesting and **diverse problems** is what
makes this job so exciting and fun.

My favourite framework is **React**, and even though I've been using it for
many years since it's inception, it's still a lot of fun to work with and
doesn't get boring since the eco system is changing every year.
