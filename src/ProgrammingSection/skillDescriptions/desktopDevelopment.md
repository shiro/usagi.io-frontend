Through the years I've worked with **WPF** to build
Windows tools that support users' workflows and used **Rust** together with **GTK** for
some simple high-performance applications that run on Linux.

I also plan to look into other popular technologies and frameworks that aim to
bridge the gap between devices and work everywhere.
Although I've been using **React** extensively for web development,
I'm also looking forward to working with **React native** more in the future.
