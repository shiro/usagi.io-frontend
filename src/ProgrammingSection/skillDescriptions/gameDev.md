I also really enjoy working on **game ideas** that seem fun and original.
My favourite game engine is **Unity**. I've used it extensively and enjoy using it a lot.
I find **C#** very convinient for game development, however my **C/C++** experience
allows me to maximize performance in important parts when needed.

Games are fun to play, but making them is equally fun as they represent a way to
express myself **without any limitations**.
