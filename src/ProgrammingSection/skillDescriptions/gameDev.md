I also really enjoy working on **game ideas** that seem fun and original.
Extensive experience on game engines such as **Unity** allows me to
implement my ideas efficiently. My knowledge of low level
programming languages allows me to optimize critical components to maximize
performance when required.

Games are fun to play, but making them is equally fun as they represent a way to
express myself **without any limitations**.
