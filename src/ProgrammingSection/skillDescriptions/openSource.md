One of the things that always fascinated me is **Open source development**.
In a world where software companies dictate how software works and looks like, there
is little room for imagination and customization.

In this regard, open source is really a breath of fresh air and in my opinion the future
of all software development.
Being able to share code **freely** and benefit from each other without expecting anything
in return sounds like a broken system, however it turned out to work really well.

The aim of open source projects is not profit, but bringing people who enjoy working
on some project **together**. I enjoy being part of this system, contributing and
benefiting from open source projects.
