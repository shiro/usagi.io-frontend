In a time when big companies prevent any customization of application code, 
open source is really a breath of fresh air and in my opinion the future
of all software development.

Being able to share code **freely** and benefit from **each other** by
developin software with the community at large is great, and
I enjoy being part of this system, contributing and
benefiting from open source projects.
