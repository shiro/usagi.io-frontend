I find traveling around interesting places important to get a better overview of
the world and avoid being stuck in a box.

Photography allows capturing a single moment and look at it later, which is a great
way to keep memories and express oneself by observing others.

Here is my public collection of pictures I took, and some of my other design work.
I hope one day someone will enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it.
